<h3>The Beginning</h3>

<p>I don’t really know where to start with this, all I know is that I want this to somehow be useful to anyone that reads it. I want it to provide information and advice if possible but also just a feeling for what is happening.</p>
<p>I guess the best place to start is at the beginning. But to do that I suppose I need to also mention the end. On December 12 2013 my mum died. She died as a result of Cancer of the Vulva. It was awful and the worst time of my life, and it WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO GET TO THIS.</p>
<p>Approx 9 years ago, I can’t even remember when exactly….I was down near London at a meeting with my boss. On the way into the meeting, I got a phonecall from my mum. She had been to the Drs and was ringing to tell me what had happened. For a number of months/years mum had suffered with a lot of discomfort around her private area…itching/redness etc. At first they thought she had developed an allergy to latex. My mum taught aerobics for over 30 years and in that time wore the classic leggings etc that most people doing exercise do……we were surprised as we assumed that the allergy would go everywhere and to this day I don’t believe she did have this. I think it was always the early signs of the cancer. Anyway, I received the call whilst walking across the car-park and to this day the only words I really remember we – PRE-CANCEROUS SKIN CELLS ON THE URETHA, TINY, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT –  that was it. It wasn’t cancer, it was just a few cells with anomalies, and to this day, I regret not taking this more seriously, I regret not asking more questions and not understanding more. BUT IT WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT…… </p>

<p>So I guess this is a good place to put the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/vulvarcancer/detailedguide/vulvar-cancer-diagnosis" target="_blank">early symptoms of Cancer of the Vulva</a></p>
<p>Invasive squamous cell cancer of the vulva</p>
<p>Almost all women with invasive vulvar cancers will have symptoms. The symptoms of early invasive vulvar cancer are similar to those that can be seen with VIN. As the cancer grows, a distinct tumor may be seen. The cancer might appear as a red, pink, or white bump (or bumps) with a wart-like or raw surface. The area could also appear white and feel rough.
About half of the women with vulvar cancer complain of persistent itching and a growth. Some also complain of pain, burning, painful urination, and bleeding and discharge not associated with the normal menstrual period. An open sore (ulcer) that persists for more than a month is another sign. </p>

<h3>Following the phone call</h3>
<p>Mum had to have a MINOR operation to have the PRE CANCEROUS SKIN CELLS on the URETHA (not cancer) cells removed.</p>
<p>(It is probably important to highlight here that mum did NOT have Cancer and she did not have Cancer of the URETHA although for some time this is what we thought she had– but there is a link to this on the site here as it may help provide information)</p>
<p>This caused my mum some discomfort of course, and when I think back now I wander how much she wasn’t telling us. For years we used to joke that my mum was glued to the chair in the living room. She wasn’t quite as active as she used to be, but looking back, was this mum just being mum (and volunteering my Dad for everything) or was it more.  It’s hard to know, because even at the end my mum rarely talked about what was happening, she rarely asked for pain relief, which was INSANE, and didn’t want to be a nuisance to anyone. The truth is we will never know.</p>
<p>When I look back at these sites, I wander if I actually looked at them in the beginning. It’s a long time back and in that time I have had two children, but I can’t recall doing so. I also think if I had, I may have been more prepared for the future, but considering we thought she had PRE CANCEROUS CELLS OF THE URETHA we would have been led down the wrong road anyway.</p>
<p>I wish I had <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Vulval-Intra-epithelial-Neoplasia.htm" target="_blank">read this article.</a></p>
<p>“If you have a persistent itch of the vulva, or any other persistent symptom of the vulva, then see your doctor. It may be a condition called vulval intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN). This is a skin condition of the vulva. It is not cancer. However, it is classed as a precancerous condition, as in some women VIN (after several years) may develop into vulval cancer.”
I look back, and my memories around the time are so vague, she had the surgery, she was ok……..for a while</p>
