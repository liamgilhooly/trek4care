	<p>My name is Vicki Burton. I am 38 years old and on December 12th 2013 I lost my mum to Cancer of the Vulva. </p>
	
	<p>In short we didn't realise how serious things were. In April 2013 we found out that she had to have major surgery. At one point this was to be a full pelvic clearout, but became a vulvectomy.  She then went back into surgery on the 23rd of July to have a stoma fitted, but the surgery was called off (whilst my mum was under GA) as the cancer had returned and spread. Mum was told she needed Chemo. In the August my brother and I spoke to her cancer nurse, with her permission, to try and help us understand what was happening and we found out then my mum had six months to two years. In the end she lived only four months.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>To learn more about this story and my journey please <a href="blog.html">visit my blog</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For the last  two months or so of my mum's life she was cared for by the amazing Bradford Marie Curie Cancer Care unit.</p>
	
	<p>Their dedication, expertise, care and sensitivity to not just my mum, but to me and my entire family, was nothing short of incredible.</p>
	
	<p>After losing my mum I found myself wondering how I could thank them for all they did. The only real difference I could make was to raise money. But I wanted to honour my mum too and by chance and at the opportune moment I saw an advertisement for a Trek to Sri Lanka and so my mission began. The trek would help raise vital funds for the hospice and give me an amazing experience in memory of my mum. The trip costs, &#163;3,250 with half of this going to the unit. This isn't enough for me:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>It costs &#163;9,000 a day to run the unit.</li>
	<li>It costs &#163;20 an hour to provide a nurse.</li>
	<li>My mums care cost a minimum of &#163;16,000 (based on 1 nurse - but she always had two)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>My focus and ambition is try and PAY back for my mums care. I want to raise a minimum of &#163;16,000, and know that I have helped others receive the support and care that we did.</p>
	<p>And so this site was born, first to help people buy tickets for one of <a href="events.html">the events</a> that I am hosting, but now it is so much more. I hope that this site will help you if you are in my position, whether to find a useful link or to help understand this terrible illness, this site will be here.</p>
